# Message Parser and Redis Server with Kubernetes

## Project Overview

This project is a simple web service that allows users to submit messages, which are then parsed and stored in a Redis Server. Think of it as a voicemail system where users can leave messages. To make this project production-ready, we'll deploy the application on Kubernetes. The first step in this process is to Dockerize the application.

## Getting Started

### Dockerize Your Application

Dockerizing your application involves creating a Docker image that encapsulates your application code along with its dependencies and runtime environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Create a `Dockerfile` in your project directory to define how the Docker image should be built. You can adapt the example provided earlier in this README.

2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the `docker build` command to build your Docker image. Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and execute:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-image-name:tag .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container Locally**: To test your Docker image locally before deploying it to Kubernetes, run the Docker container using:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:3000 your-image-name:tag
   ```

   This maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 3000 in the container.

### Push Docker Image to a Container Registry

To use your Docker image in Kubernetes, you need to store it in a container registry. Here's how you can push your Docker image to Docker Hub (replace placeholders with your actual values):

1. **Login to Docker Hub**:

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Tag and Push the Image**:

   ```bash
   docker tag your-image-name:tag <your-dockerhub-username>/your-image-name:tag
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/your-image-name:tag
   ```

### Kubernetes Configuration

Kubernetes requires configuration files to define the resources your application needs, such as Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps. An example Deployment YAML for your application might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app-container
        image: <your-dockerhub-username>/your-image-name:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

### Apply Kubernetes Resources

Use the `kubectl` command to apply your Kubernetes configuration files:

```bash
kubectl apply -f your-deployment.yaml
```

### Expose Your Service

You may want to expose your application to the internet using a Service or Ingress. Create a Kubernetes Service to make your application accessible.

### Monitoring and Scaling

Implement monitoring and scaling as needed, using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers.

### Continuous Deployment (Optional)

Consider automating the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines to update your application in Kubernetes whenever you make changes to your code.

### Testing and Debugging

Ensure your application is running smoothly in the Kubernetes environment. Use tools like `kubectl logs` and debugging tools to troubleshoot issues.

## Customize for Your Application

Adapt the provided steps and configurations to suit your specific application, requirements, and infrastructure. Documentation and deployment configurations may vary depending on your project's needs.
